WELDON - This Memorial Day holiday drivers may get a break from the work place but not from the high prices at the pump.

The costs of gasoline seems to be increasing every day and a gallon of regular unleaded will now cost you nearly $4.

Friday, The Associated Press reported another overnight jump in the price of gas -up nearly 20 percent, or 65 cents a gallon, over the past year to average nearly $3.88 a gallon nationally. The national report noted that “pump prices now show no signs of halting their daily assault on the record books.”

Nationally, the price of a gallon of regular gas rose 4.4 cents overnight from Thursday to Friday to a record average of $3.875, according to AAA and the Oil Price Information Service. Prices are headed even higher in coming days because of oil's dramatic rally this week to a new record over $135 a barrel.
